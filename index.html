						<h2>Large communities</h2>

						<p>
							Throughout my development career, I've had the
							fantastic opportunity of developing at some of the
							most significant communities on Roblox. All of these
							communities together accumulate to over 2 million
							members and over 950 million total visits.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							My time in these groups has given me an unspeakable
							opportunity to develop and refine my skills as a
							programmer on Roblox. Alongside this, they have
							given me a priceless perspective on my skill as a
							developer, my limits and how much further I need to
							go.
